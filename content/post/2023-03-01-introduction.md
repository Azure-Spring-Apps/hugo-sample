Welcome to our Azure Spring Apps Community. 

We are excited to introduce you to the *Azure Spring Apps* community, a space where developers come together to learn, share and collaborate on building modern applications using Azure Spring Apps. Whether you are an experienced developer or just getting started, this community is a great place to connect with like-minded individuals and get the support you need to succeed. We will share our experiences and best practices around Azure Spring Apps. We hope you find our stories, our examples, our tips and tricks, our recipes and best practices useful in your daily work with Azure Spring Apps. We invite you to contribute and share your stories and articles.

Azure Spring Apps is a fully managed service that allows developers to manage the lifecycle of their Spring and polyglot applications. Azure Spring Apps (formerly Azure Spring Cloud) is built jointly by Microsoft Azure and VMware Tanzu and provides hassle-free way of managing the infrastructure to securely host all your Spring and polyglot applications. In the next set of articles we will further explore how to get started with Azure Spring Apps.
